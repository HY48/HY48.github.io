                    <span>
                        Hi, I'm Xavier, a 20 year old Undergraduate Student from Minnesota.
                        You probably know me by HY48, Tsana (this one especially if you play 
                        <a href="https://etternaonline.com">Etterna</a>), or TsanaManzana.

                    <br><br>
                    <span>
                        I am currently enrolled at the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/">University of 
                        Minnesota (CSE) - Twin Cities</a> studying Computer Science with the intention of
                        focusing on Operating Systems.
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>
                        I have a particular interest in Operating Systems, Systems Programming, 
                        and Computer Architecture.
                        Most of what I write is in C, C++, and Rust and I also occasionally 
                        program in OCaml (thank you 
                        <a href="https://umtc.catalog.prod.coursedog.com/courses/8103471">CSCI 2041</a>).
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>
                        Besides nerd stuff, I enjoy cycling, listening to music (no genre in 
                        particular), reading crappy manga, and cooking (it's good for the soul and the wallet). 
                    </span>

                    <h3>About this page</h3>
                    <span>
                        I began writing this page with the intention of centralizing my presence online, 
                        something I can point towards when people ask who I am, where can they find me, and
                        what do I do.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Besides marking my spot online, I also wanted to put some of what I learned in my
                        internet programming course 
                        (<a href="https://umtc.catalog.prod.coursedog.com/courses/7906541">CSCI 4131</a>) 
                        to use.
                        <br><br> 
                        This also means that in the future I plan to self host this site with subdomains and stuff.
